# Task Description
# The programme allows the user to calculate interest gained and home loan repayments.
# On initialisation, the user has a choice between the "investment" and "bond" modes; chosen by entering the desired mode.
# "Investment" mode asks for the amount invested, the interest rate, how many years this amount will be invested for, and [...]
# [...] whether it is a simple or compound interest. The programme then calculates the interest gained, based on the previous [...]
# [...] details.
# "Bond" mode asks for the value of the house, the interest rate, and how many months the user plans to repay the bond. The [...]
# [...] programme converts the interest rate into a monthly rate, to be used in calculating the amount needed to be paid [...]
# [..] for the desired amount of months.
